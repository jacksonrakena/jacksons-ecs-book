# Introduction

Welcome to a collection of my notes from my time at Victoria University of Wellington's School of Engineering and Computer Science.
  

I initally wrote this guide to serve as a reference for my friends to get set up with some ECS technology, but I've since expanded it to include more general information about the courses I've taken and my experiences with them.

I hope this guide can be as impartial as I can possible make it, and that you find it useful in your journeys.

### Goals of the book
- Provide a reference for ECS students to get set up with the various technologies used in ECS courses.
- Deliver impartial information about various course options, from a student-centric perspective (in contrast to information given by the University)
- Explain topics about studying in the Faculty of Engineering that are not covered in the Faculty's own information.

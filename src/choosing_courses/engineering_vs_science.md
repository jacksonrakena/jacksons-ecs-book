# Engineering vs. Science - what's the difference?

Possibly one of the most contentious topics in all of ECS is the difference between the **Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)** degree (4 years) or the **Bachelor of Science (majoring in Computer Science)** degree (3 years). The two degrees are very similar, but there are some key differences that you should be aware of.

You should always note the bias of whoever you're receiving information from. The University will always tell you that the BE is the best option, and that the BSc is a "lesser" degree. However, this is not necessarily true. This document will try to be as impartial as possible, and will try to give you the information you need to make an informed decision.

For disclosure purposes, the author of this article is studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours).

> Note: the Bachelor of Science with Honours  
>   
> The **Bachelor of Science with Honours** is 1-year Honours degree that can be taken after completing a **Bachelor of Science**. This degree replaces ENGR489 (Engineering Project) from the BE with COMP489. These are very similar, 30-point courses, but COMP489 is more research-focused while ENGR489 is more engineering-focused (making a product).

Here are some of the differences:
  
**Why you should pick Engineering:**
- The Bachelor of Engineering is accredited by Engineering New Zealand.
- In the BE, you **must** take the following courses:
  - ENGR 101 & 110 (first-year)
  - ENGR 201 (second-year, second trimester)
  - ENGR 301 & 302 (third year)
  - ENGR 401 & 489 (fourth year)
- In addition, in the BE, you must complete the following:
  - 800 hours of (paid) work experience, which consists of:
    - 400 hours of "professional" work experience (working in industry)
    - 400 hours of practical work experience (basically anything)
    - This is usually done over the summer of your second and third years. It is a requirement to graduate.
  - Six "industry" events, such as meetups, conferences, etc.
    - Each event must be followed by a 300-word "blog post" about who you met, what you saw, etc.
- Arguably, the BE prepares you better for travelling internationally to work, as it is accredited by Engineering New Zealand, which represents New Zealand in the Washington Accord.
  - (This is a very contentious point, and is not necessarily true.)
- Engineering students (arguably) receive priority in some Summer of Tech applications.

**Why you should pick Science:**
- The BSc allows you to take many more non-ECS courses, as well as a minor (if you are interested in that). This is a great option if you are interested in doing a minor in something else the University offers, or if you want to take a lot of non-ECS courses.
- The BSc is one less year of university study.
- It is still up for debate whether the BE prepares you any better for a career in industry than the BSc. The BE is accredited by Engineering New Zealand, but this is **certainly** not a requirement for a job in industry, especially in the SWEN (Software Engineering) major.
- The BSc can be cheaper, as you don't have to pay for the fourth year, and ENGR first-year courses are among the more expensive (usually ~$200-500 more expensive than comparable first-year options)

### Can I transfer between the two?

#### BE -> BSc
Transferring from the Bachelor of Engineering to the Bachelor of Science is **very** easy. Normally, students will transfer at the end of their first or second year, but transferring at the end of the third year is also possible. This is a popular option for students who do not wish to study a fourth year at university, and (usually) does not require any additional courses to be completed.

#### BSc -> BE
Transferring from the Bachelor of Science to the Bachelor of Engineering is difficult. If you are in your second year, it is difficult to waive the ENGR101/110 requirement as these are required by Engineering New Zealand. It is best to consult with a course advisor and the faculty office for more information. A more common route for students in this position is to take a **Bachelor of Science with Honours**. (see the note above)

### Will students see me as 'lesser' for one or the other?
While the topic is always a point for jokes and memes, the answer is **no**. Anyone telling you otherwise is showing their own insecurities or bias towards one degree or the other. You will not be treated differently by lecturers in any of the common courses for being in one strand or the other. This decision is highly personal and depends on your interests, resources, abilities, and goals.

# ECS student-run server

The ECS Discord is a student and alumni-run server for ECS students and alumni. It is a great place to socialise, ask questions, and get help with ECS courses.


### Join
[ECS - Discord](https://discord.gg/GPtvtK4)

### Verifying and course channels
After you join, you should run `+verify YOUR_USERNAME@myvuw.ac.nz` to become verified. After verification, you will be able to join course channels, like this:
```
+join comp102 cybr171 engr101
```

You will then be able to access channels for the courses you have joined.

### Disclosure
The ECS server is not officially affiliated with any ECS department or staff member. Staff members are politely asked to leave the server if they are not students or alumni.

Rules and policies of the server are independent of the University's policies.

As of writing, there are no Discord servers officially run by the Wellington Faculty of Engineering or its constituent schools.
